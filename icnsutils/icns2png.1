.TH ICOTOOL "1" "March 10, 2008" "icns2png (libicns)"
.SH NAME
icns2png \- Convert Macintosh icns files to png images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B icns2png
.RI [ options ]... " " [ file ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page document describes the \fBicns2png\fP command.

The \fBicns2png\fP program converts Macintosh icons from icns files,
Macintosh resource files (.rsrc) and MacBinary resource forks (.bin)

.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-extract
This option tells icns2png that images from all icon images
given on the command line are to be extracted. Filter options
(see below) can be used to control what images that will be
extracted.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-list
This options tells icns2png that images in all given icon images
are to be listed. The output will look something like this:


.TP
.B \-c, \-\-create XXX
This options tells icns2png to create an icon file using all the
PNG files given on the command line, in the order they were specified.
The number of bits per pixel used in the icon file will depend
on the number of colors used in the PNG file. (If the PNG image has an
indexed palette, it doesn't necessarily mean that the same palette will
be used in the created icon file.)
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-index=\fIN\fR
When listing or extracing files, this options tell icns2png to list or
extract only the N'th image in each file. The first image has index 1.

This option has no effect in create mode.
.B \-w, \-\-width=\fIPIXELS\fR
Similar to --index, but this option allows the image width to be matched
instead. This option has no effect in create mode.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-height=\fIPIXELS\fR
Similar to --index, but this option allows the image height to be matched
instead. This option has no effect in create mode.
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-bit-depth=\fICOUNT\fR
Similar to --index, but this option allows the number of bits per pixel
in the image to be matched instead. Valid values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24
and 32.

.TP
.B \-t, \-\-alpha\-threshold=\fILEVEL\fR
Specifies the maximal alpha level in the PNG image for portions which 
shall become transparent in the icon created. The default value is 127.
This is only used when creating icon images.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output=\fIPATH\fR
In extract mode, this option specifies a directory where extracted
files are to be created. If PATH does not exist, it is assumed that
it refers to a non-existing file instead. The first image matched
will be extracted to the file with that name.

If PATH is `-', then all output will be printed to standard out.

This option has no effect in list mode.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Output version information and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
List all images in the file `demo.ico':
.br
  $ \fBicns2png -l demo.ico\fP
  --icon --index=1 --width=16 --height=16 --bit-depth=4 --palette-size=16
.PP
List only 16-color images in `demo.ico':
.br
  $ \fBicns2png -l --palette-size=16 demo.ico\fP
  --icon --index=1 --width=16 --height=16 --bit-depth=4 --palette-size=16
