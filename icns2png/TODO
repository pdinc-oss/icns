TODO

1) Rename functions to make more sense in the context of icns
2) Modify Makefile to build static and dymanic libraries from icns.c
3) Modify Makefile to link icns2png against the library instead of directly
4) Split libicns and icon2png into seperate trees
   |icns
   \- libicns
   \- icon2png
5) Update icns2png to support extraction of any icon type (support is in libicns)
