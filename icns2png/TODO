TODO

1) Rename functions to make more sense in the context of icns
2) Modify Makefile to build static and dymanic libraries from icns.c
3) Modify Makefile to link icns2png against the library instead of directly
4) Split libicns and icon2png into seperate trees
   |icns
   \- libicns
   \- icon2png
